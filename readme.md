# Telegram Recipe Bot
[Telegram username: @tasty_explorer_bot](https://t.me/tasty_explorer_bot)

Our Telegram bot utilizes TheMealDB API to provide users with a variety of cooking recipes. The bot can find recipes based on complexity, present random recipes, search for recipes with a specific ingredient, and much more.

## Command Functionality

Here are all commands that our bot supports:

- **`/search`**: Users can input a key ingredient they have on hand or definite meal to find, and the bot will return recipes that include that ingredient.

- **`/random`**: Returns a random recipe. This can be a fun way for users to discover new recipes they might not have tried otherwise.

- **`/favorites`**: Shows saved recipes.

- **`/low`**: Fetches the simplest recipes based on the number of ingredients. Users can specify a type of dish (like "dessert" or "main course"), and the bot will return the simplest recipes within that category.

- **`/high`**: Retrieves the most complex recipes, also based on the number of ingredients. This can be a fun challenge for users who are more experienced cooks and want to try something new.

- **`/custom`**: Users can specify a range for the number of ingredients, and the bot would return recipes that fall within that range.

- **`/list`**: Returns a list of all Categories, Area, Ingredients

- **`/history`**: Retrieves the last ten queries a user made.

- **`/cancel`**: Stops ongoing operations (or just use another command).
